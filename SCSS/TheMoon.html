<p id="welcome">The Moon </p>
<p id="second">by Lydia Davis, 2014.</p>
<p id="third">I get up out of bed in the night. My room is large, and dark
    but for the white dog on the floor. I leave the room. The hall-
    way is wide and long, and filled with an underwater sort of 
    twilight. I reach the doorwar of the bathroom and see that it is
flooded with bright light. There is a full moon far above, over-
head. Its beam is coming in through the window and falling 
directly on the toilet seat, as if sent by a helpful God. 
</p> 
<p id="fourth"> Then I am back in bed. I have been lying there awake for a 
    while. The room is lighter than it was. The moon is coming
    around to this side of the building. I think. But no, it is 
    the beginning of dawn.
