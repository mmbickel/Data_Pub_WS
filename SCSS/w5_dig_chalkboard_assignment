Write a function lastItem() that takes one parameter.
The parameter will be an array that you can hard code into an onclick event on the button.
onclick="lastItem(['Watermelon', 'Apple', 'Orange', 'Kiwi'])"
Prepare a div on your page to display some output.
The function should output the original array on the page: ['Watermelon', 'Apple', 'Orange', 'Kiwi'].
The function should output the item that is last alphabetically: Watermelon.
Test your function by adding new values to the array.
You can just console.log the value.


Write a function that asks for four different things, then sorts them alphabetically and displays them on the HTML page.
Ask the user four times to provide the name of a thing: fruit, animal, state, and country.
After they submit the fourth value, display the four values in original order then sorted alphabetically.
You can decide how the function is invoked.
You can decide what sort of input strategy to use.
There are many ways to make this happen. It's up to you.
