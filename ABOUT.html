</p><strong>houseguest history</strong></p>
<p>Image: Kiah Celeste's installation as part of "Industry Fossils & Germinating Sunshine" (2020) </p>

<p id="third">HOUSEGUEST is an independent, non-commercial, artist-run incubator and project space located in Louisville, Kentucky. The space was founded in January of 2018 by artist Megan Bickel and chef, Jacob Wilson. Its location is within the front room of Megan’s home. The space holds five-six exhibitions a year exploring various topics relevant to the zeitgeist. We are working hard to ensure the exhibition of local artists and collaboration with local curators, but will always work to integrate or introduce artists that are from outside of Louisville. We encourage artists to interact with and activate the space while exploring new ideas and concepts, with full control over what they create.

  Until March of 2020 when impacts of Covid-19 began to impact us all in the U.S,  each exhibition was partnered with a small SUPPERCLUB lab dinner, occasionally with collaborating chefs from around the region. It is our hope in the near future we can resume this program, until then it is on hiatus. Once it returns hope to continue creating a destination for artists, chefs, curators, and organizers to feel safe to explore, experiment, learn, and participate in a dialogue around various topics.
</p>
</p> As some of you may know, our founder and organizer, Megan Bickel, has temporarily relocated to Chicago in pursuit of her Masters in Digital Studies at the University of Chicago.

Brooklin Grantz, who interned with houseguest last year, has moved into the home and transitioned into their role as the organizer for 2022!

If you don’t know Brooklin, here is a little bit of their background:
</p>
</p>
Brooklin Grantz was born and raised in Southern Indiana where they received their Bachelor of Fine Arts in Ceramics from Indiana University Southeast. They have interned at the Archie Bray Foundation for the Ceramic Arts, Sugar Maples Center for Creative Arts, houseguest gallery, and have assisted at Arrowmount School of Arts and Crafts. Brooklin currently lives in Louisville, Kentucky, making work exploring form, texture, and emotion in functional objects.

 <p>land acknowledgement</p>
</p>houseguest/YARDSIDE recognizes the harm caused during centuries of forced assimilation, relocation, and genocide, and the lasting systemic effects Indigenous peoples endure today. Major tribes that lived on the land that is now called Kentucky are the Shawnee, Cherokee, Osage, Adena, and Hopewell. These cultures had many traditions and customs that were both unique to individual tribes and shared across them. Indigenous peoples have inhabited Kentucky for over 12,000 years.They built permanent settlements that were inhabited for hundreds to thousands of years at a time. Forced removal has led these groups elsewhere in the United States, but large populations still remain in Kentucky. According to 2010 Census data, there are over 30,000 Native Americans who still live in the Bluegrass state. Currently, the Cherokee, Shawnee, and Osage have headquarters in Oklahoma. Louisville, Kentucky is a city deeply rooted in colonization and forced removal of Indigenous people. 
</p>Colonization is “the action or process of settling among and establishing control over the indigenous people of an area.”  Colonization is a daily practice in America, and we must work to combat this by acknowledging the harm done to Native Americans in the past and present, while amplifying their voices and listening to their needs. With this in mind, houseguest promises to be deliberate in including Native voices in our space. Over the next two years, we will host at least one exhibition featuring an Indigenous artist or artists and two Indigenous artists lectures. In addition, houseguest will offer free educational material on Native American history decolonization. 
</p>
</p></li>Indigenous peoples still face discrimination, oppression, and assimilation today in healthcare, education, and the workplace due to these spaces being primarily white/non-Native. Predominantly white spaces are the direct result of white supremacy and a history of imperialism, colonialism, and racist thinking that leads to gaps in quality of schooling,  healthcare, and labor compensation. By acknowledging these realities, we as a society can work towards correcting the systems that harm Indigenous peoples now and in the past. </li></p>
  <ul>
    <li> students who attend non-tribal, public schools experience higher dropout rates that are closely linked to cultural conflict between them and non-Indigenous students: “Research has routinely shown that Indigenous cultural values often directly conflict with European American values such as competition, focusing on the individual rather than the community, and putting oneself forward."</li>
    <li>Higher dropout rates lead to higher rates of unemployment and lower incomes in Native communities.</li>
    <li>The Indian Health Service is severely underfunded, spending only $1914 per patient per year.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<div class="container px-4">
  <div class="row gx-5">
<p id="welcome">Acknowledgement is the first step in amending the grievances experienced by Native Americans, but it is not enough. We must ensure we are actively working to keep Indigenous lives and spaces safe and seen while correcting the narrative that Native Americans are uncivil, not advanced, and not knowledgeable. Following acknowledgment comes decolonization and reconciliation, which can take place at an individual and an institutional level. If you are of settler ancestry, there are many ways you can contribute to decolonization and support the Indigenous people around you. Advocating for Indigenous representation in local and state government, donating to organizations benefiting Native groups, and participating in direct mutual aid/crowdsourcing are a start. More direct ways to reconcile include giving land back to Indigenous peoples. The Land Back Movement encourages people of settler descent to discover and connect with those who originally inhabited the land they live on or “own” and eventually form a consensual relationship that can lead to returning the land to Indigenous people or tribes of the area.  This is all in respect and consideration of Indigenous people’s desires and visions. </p>
