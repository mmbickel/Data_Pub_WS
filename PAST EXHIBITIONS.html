        <p>Alivia Blade is a visual artist from Louisville, KY. She is a graduate of Columbia College Chicago where she graduated with a BA in graphic design, and created collaborative installation works around memory, childhood and gender performance. Alivia presently explores these themes through sculpture, fashion, design and creative writing. 
        </p>
        <p>wandering home is a collection of explorations I started during quarantine in 2020. At the start of the pandemic, I moved back to Louisville from Chicago to be with family and also decided to begin my solo career as a visual artist. My work explores memory, stories from childhood, and how these experiences presently affect my life. I was drawn to hair tools and products, and began experimenting with synthetic hair, combs and accessories as sculpture. I incorporated other objects found in the home, and created pieces that can be worn on the body as well. These explorations not only function as tools to process past experiences, but they’ve also been a tool of therapy while enduring the isolation of the pandemic. Process has become a very important aspect of my artistic practice. Creating these works has highlighted the way process is not linear. One may revisit the same place several times within a process, and intentions, goals, purpose can shift. There is a surrendering of control which also invites other possibilities into the process. Whether concerning my artistic practice or personal life, this year has offered many invitations to surrender, release, and lean into all the possibilities.

        <p>Jerusalem stone is the special type of pale limestone used in building since at least the 17th century BCE. The stone gives the Old City of Jerusalem its ancient feel. However, the stone has become a symbol of control, visually enforcing the boundaries of the city and allowing for newly annexed neighborhoods to appear as part of the same lineage as the historic city center, miles away. To this end, a 1968 Israeli mandate requires all new buildings in the city of Jerusalem to be faced with the stone, because, according to the city planners, it carries “emotional messages that stimulate other sensations embedded in our collective memory.”

          This emotional message extends far beyond the material connection of ancient architecture to suburban sprawl. Jerusalem stone is used in the diaspora as a means to give a sense of Jewish identity to architecture. Contemporary synagogue design frequently employs Jerusalem stone to simulate the Western Wall, or to serve as a backdrop on the Bimah. Indeed, Jerusalem can be a container for both trauma inflicted and trauma received, and it becomes a prism through which we project a sense of identity. It can symbolize connection to Jewish identity or assert dangerous colonial agendas. 
        </p>
         <p> In Same Thing From a Distance,  Liam Ze’ev O’Connor presents new sculptures coated in artificial Jerusalem stone. To make these works, Liam pulls from a range of specific personal and cultural references: the windows of the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati, liquor bottles from the streets of Oakland, Judaica from across the diaspora, and shells from the California coast. In coating these objects with artificial stone, Liam explores what it means to take this stone– an externally facing, public symbol– and wrestle it away from the dominant Zionist narrative, instead mixing it with domestic and ritual objects.

        <p>Jen Dwyer Artist Statement</p>
        <p>The Female Gaze is an alternative way of seeing that represents everyone as a subject and
          acknowledges that people have their own complicated narratives. With this idea in mind, I
          construct fanciful, porcelain vessels and sculptures housed within my installations adorned with
          acrylic & oil paintings, that merge iconography from prehistoric imagery, (such as the Venus of
          Willendorf, which was thought to be a self portrait of the artist), with the Rococo Asthetic,
          infused with contemporary feminist themes. I create an amalgamation of ceramic sculpture and
          paintings to examine contemporary socially constructed notions of identity by invoking the
          female gaze. 
          <p>The Female Gaze, coined by Jill Soloway, was created in response to Laura
          Mulvey’s theorization of “the Male Gaze,” which is when cinematic depictions of women are
          seen as objects of male pleasure. The Female Gaze is an alternative way of seeing; a way of
          looking/representing that seeks to give everyone agency and make everyone a subject. Rococo
          art was created in reaction to boredom with the serious baroque style, and instead opted to
          depict humor, wit, emotion, and whimsy. Characterized by its light-heartedness, the Rococo
          presents itself at a more intimate scale, often in private spaces. I aim to create other worldly
          Installations, filled with my ceramic sculptures, to blurr the barriers between the private and
          public, subject and object and self and others.</p>
          <p>Gracelee Lawerence Artist Statement</p>
          <p>My work deals with relationships between food, the body, and technology. It is born in the transfigurative space between physical and digital reality, exploring the ways in which bodies are both gendered and metaphorically fragmented in terms of capitalist-driven material desires, physical sustenance, and the digital spaces we inhabit. There is a waning tension between digital and physical space, and the boundaries are quickly dissolving as on average Americans spend nearly one-fifth of our waking hours on our phones. I’m interested in this shift. My work parallels these translations and our shifting perception of reality that is no longer merely relegated to sensations of the physical. 
          </p>
          <p>For the digitally tethered, life is at the intersection of the virtual and the physical. Experience is tempered through a stream of simultaneous meta-interactions, archives, extensions, and reflections of ‘experienced’ reality. The truncated and disembodied limbs, fruits, and packaging parallel the fragmentation and compartmentalization encouraged in digital space by questioning literal and metaphorical touch, or even the sensation of closeness, between bodies. This work becomes whole through the translation and recombination of the digital and physical, relying equally on digital fabrication and hand augmentation. Made using digital fabrication and human labor, the objects themselves come into existence from the reciprocal translation of the digital to the physical (and vice-versa), ending with a physical manifestation. In our current technology-focused world, the action of physical making through digital means underpins my belief in the potential of technology and the power of objectness, the importance of things that unapologetically hold their mass in the world.
